React Native Assigment- S Shyam Sankar
I have done a Timer with limited Functionalities. I was not able to do it completely as per requirement but I have tried my best for that.

I have used Expo for this assigmnent and I have attached the APK link below.
APK LINK : https://expo.dev/accounts/gomathyshyam/projects/healthflex/builds/0365a21e-c5be-4474-a240-161a7467a70f

I have implemented the Timer with Start, Stop and Reset Functionality and I have tried to implement History of timers using AsyncStorage but can't able to complete sucessfully.

Thank You
